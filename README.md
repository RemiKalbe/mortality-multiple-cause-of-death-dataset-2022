# Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death Dataset: Preprocessed

This repository contains the *preprocessed* version of the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death dataset, provided by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The original dataset can be found on the [NCHS website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Mortality_Multiple).

## Dataset Description

The Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death dataset contains detailed mortality information for individuals who died in the United States within a given year. It includes various attributes such as demographic information, cause of death, lifestyle factors, and medical conditions.

The original dataset is provided in a complex format, with each row having a fixed width and no separators or headers. The data is encoded using numbers and characters, making it challenging to work with directly.

To make the dataset more accessible and usable, I have preprocessed it and translated it into a more friendly format. The resulting dataset is stored as a Parquet file, which is a columnar storage format that provides efficient compression, encoding schemes and **retain the schema**.

<!-- For a detailed explanation of the thought process and the preprocessing steps, please refer to my blog post: [Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death Dataset: A Journey of Data Preprocessing](https://remi.boo/tbd). -->

## Dataset Location

The preprocessed dataset can be found in the `datasets` folder of this repository. The Parquet file is named `MMCD_2022.parquet` and contains the cleaned and structured version of the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death dataset.

If you are primarily interested in using the preprocessed dataset, you can directly access the Parquet file from the `datasets` folder.
